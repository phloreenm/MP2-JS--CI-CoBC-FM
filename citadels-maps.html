        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Histria or Istros (Ancient Greek: Ἰστρίη, Thracian river god, Danube),
          was a Greek colony or polis (πόλις, city) near the mouths of the
          Danube (known as Ister in Ancient Greek), on the western coast of the
          Black Sea. It was the first urban settlement on today's Romanian
          territory when founded by Milesian settlers in the 7th century BC. It
          was under Roman rule from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. Invasions
          during the 7th century AD rendered it indefensible, and the city was
          abandoned. In antiquity, it also bore the names Istropolis,
          Istriopolis, and Histriopolis (Ἰστρόπολις, Ἰστρία πόλις).[1]
          <br><br> Histriopolis was a fort in the Roman province of Moesia. As Tabula
          Peutingeriana shows it is situated between Tomis and Ad Stoma; 11
          miles from Tomis and 9 miles from Ad Stoma.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          According to Jordanes (after Cassiodorus), the foundation of the city
          was ascribed to Tomyris, the queen of the Massagetae (the origin and
          deeds of the Goths):
          <span style="font-size: 1.1em">
            After achieving this victory (against Cyrus the Great) and winning
            so much booty from her enemies, Queen Tomyris crossed over into that
            part of Moesia which is now called Lesser Scythia - a name borrowed
            from Great Scythia -, and built on the Moesian shore of the Black
            Sea the city of Tomi, named after herself.</span

          Ruins of Tomis In 29 BC, the Romans captured the region from the
          Odrysian kingdom, and annexed it as far as the Danube, under the name
          of Limes Scythicus ("Scythian Frontier"). In AD 8, the Emperor
          Augustus banished the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17AD) here by Augustus
          for the last eight years of his life. He lamented his Tomisian exile
          in his poems Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto.<br /><br />
          Tomis was "by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural
          wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire".[13] Casino after the
          occupation of the port of Constanța by Soviet sailors in 1944. Statue
          of Ovid in front of the Museum of National History A number of
          inscriptions found in and around the city show that Constanța stands
          over the site of Tomis.[14] Some of these finds are now preserved in
          the British Museum in London.[15] The city was afterwards included in
          the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of Diocletian, in Scythia
          Minor, of which it was the metropolis.<br /><br />
          After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern Roman
          Empire. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged by the
          Avars in the winter of 597/598.<br />
          <br />
          Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the
          half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The
          earliest known usage of this name was in 950. The city lay at the
          seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and was surrounded by
          fortifications of its own.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Greek town Callatis existed until the mid-7th century under this
          name. Life in the town resumed from the 10th century. In the 13th
          century Callatis came to be known as Pangalia.[3] The Vlachs called it
          Tomisovara[4] and the Greeks called it Panglicara.[4] From the 16th
          century the town had acquired its present name, Mangalia. <br />
          A Greek colony named Callatis was founded in the 6th century BC by the
          city of Heraclea Pontica.[5] Its first silver coinage was minted
          around 350 BC. In 72 BC, Callatis was conquered by the Roman general
          Lucullus and was assigned to the Roman province of Moesia Inferior.
          Throughout the 2nd century AD, the city built defensive fortifications
          and the minting of coinage under the Roman emperors Septimius Severus
          and Caracalla continued. Callatis suffered multiple invasions in the
          3rd century AD but recovered in the 4th century AD to regain its
          status as an important trade hub and port city.[6] From the 7th to the
          11th century the city was under the rule of the First Bulgarian
          Empire.
