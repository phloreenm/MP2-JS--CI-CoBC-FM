        <h3>Short History</h3>
        <p>
          Histria or Istros (Ancient Greek: Ἰστρίη, Thracian river god, Danube),
          was a Greek colony or polis (πόλις, city) near the mouths of the
          Danube (known as Ister in Ancient Greek), on the western coast of the
          Black Sea. It was the first urban settlement on today's Romanian
          territory when founded by Milesian settlers in the 7th century BC. It
          was under Roman rule from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. Invasions
          during the 7th century AD rendered it indefensible, and the city was
          abandoned. In antiquity, it also bore the names Istropolis,
          Istriopolis, and Histriopolis (Ἰστρόπολις, Ἰστρία πόλις).[1]
          <br/><br/>
          Histriopolis was a fort in the Roman province of Moesia. As Tabula
          Peutingeriana shows it is situated between Tomis and Ad Stoma; 11
          miles from Tomis and 9 miles from Ad Stoma.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          According to Jordanes (after Cassiodorus), the foundation of the city
          was ascribed to Tomyris, the queen of the Massagetae (the origin and
          deeds of the Goths):
          <span style="font-size: 1.1em">
            After achieving this victory (against Cyrus the Great) and winning
            so much booty from her enemies, Queen Tomyris crossed over into that
            part of Moesia which is now called Lesser Scythia - a name borrowed
            from Great Scythia -, and built on the Moesian shore of the Black
            Sea the city of Tomi, named after herself.</span

          Ruins of Tomis In 29 BC, the Romans captured the region from the
          Odrysian kingdom, and annexed it as far as the Danube, under the name
          of Limes Scythicus ("Scythian Frontier"). In AD 8, the Emperor
          Augustus banished the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17AD) here by Augustus
          for the last eight years of his life. He lamented his Tomisian exile
          in his poems Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto.<br /><br />
          Tomis was "by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural
          wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire".[13] Casino after the
          occupation of the port of Constanța by Soviet sailors in 1944. Statue
          of Ovid in front of the Museum of National History A number of
          inscriptions found in and around the city show that Constanța stands
          over the site of Tomis.[14] Some of these finds are now preserved in
          the British Museum in London.[15] The city was afterwards included in
          the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of Diocletian, in Scythia
          Minor, of which it was the metropolis.<br /><br />
          After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern Roman
          Empire. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged by the
          Avars in the winter of 597/598.<br />
          <br />
          Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the
          half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The
          earliest known usage of this name was in 950. The city lay at the
          seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and was surrounded by
          fortifications of its own.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          The Greek town Callatis existed until the mid-7th century under this
          name. Life in the town resumed from the 10th century. In the 13th
          century Callatis came to be known as Pangalia.[3] The Vlachs called it
          Tomisovara[4] and the Greeks called it Panglicara.[4] From the 16th
          century the town had acquired its present name, Mangalia. <br />
          A Greek colony named Callatis was founded in the 6th century BC by the
          city of Heraclea Pontica.[5] Its first silver coinage was minted
          around 350 BC. In 72 BC, Callatis was conquered by the Roman general
          Lucullus and was assigned to the Roman province of Moesia Inferior.
          Throughout the 2nd century AD, the city built defensive fortifications
          and the minting of coinage under the Roman emperors Septimius Severus
          and Caracalla continued. Callatis suffered multiple invasions in the
          3rd century AD but recovered in the 4th century AD to regain its
          status as an important trade hub and port city.[6] From the 7th to the
          11th century the city was under the rule of the First Bulgarian
          Empire.
          <br />
          <br />
          Experts and archaeologists agree that Callatis was the most important
          cultural centre in antiquity in the entire region of Dobrudja, an area
          lying between the Danube and the Black Sea. It was a great economic
          centre, especially thanks to its harbour. Callatis was built by Greek
          colonists from Heraclea Pontica on the site of an older Getae
          settlement known as Acervatis or Cerbatis. The inhabitants were at
          first a mixture of the local Getae population and the Greeks newly
          arrived. On the site once occupied by Callatis we find today the town
          of Mangalia, with a population of around 33,000 inhabitants. Sorin
          Marcel Colesniuc, the curator of the Callatis Museum, which is part of
          the Callatis Cultural Complex, told us about what has survived to this
          day of the ancient city of Callatis: “First of all, we have a number
          of inscriptions we have dug up in Mangalia, as well as funeral stones
          featuring a number of ancient teachers. We also have the ancient
          writers in the old city of Callatis, such as Istros of Callatis,
          Demetrius of Callatis, Herakleides Lembos, and the philosopher Thales.
          In Mangalia, we found the only ancient papyrus discovered on Romanian
          territory. It was uncovered in 1959, and because the country didn’t
          have the proper conditions to preserve it, it was sent to Moscow. It
          was believed lost to researchers in Romania for half a century. I
          looked for this papyrus together with my colleague Ion Paslaru and
          found it after 2 years of searching, in 2011, at the Moscow Centre for
          Restoration and Conservation. That year we brought back to Romania
          this unique document. We don’t know exactly what the text says,
          because it disintegrated when exposed to air and sun after being
          found. It could have been lost forever, but luckily it got to Moscow
          and it was preserved. Today there are 154 surviving fragments, and on
          the larger fragments we can make out letters in ancient Greek. We
          don’t have any complete word, just a few letters here and there. The
          papyrus dates back to the 4th century BC.” We asked Sorin Marcel
          Colesniuc what visitors can see in the Callatis Museum: “The museum
          exhibits many architectural pieces, such as columns, capitals,
          architraves, friezes with metopes, cornices featuring bucrania and
          various ceramic vessels, the most important being the amphorae. There
          are also oil lamps, aqueducts, Tanagra figurines, vessels made of
          glass, funerary stelae, inscriptions, depictions of the gods, jewels,
          coins and metal objects. In front of the museum, you can see lots of
          architectural fragments. There is also an architectural park, as well
          as the sites around Mangalia. You can see the north wall of the city
          of Callatis and its north-western wall which has been dug up and
          extensively studied. Another site worth a visit is a princely tomb
          located 3 km away from Mangalia, on the way to the village of
          Albesti.” The ancient harbour provides significant insight into the
          economy of the ancient city of Callatis. Unfortunately, however, it
          lies today below the sea surface. Sorin Marcel Colesniuc, the curator
          of the Callatis Museum, explains: “The harbour in Callatis was built
          in the 4th century BC. Unfortunately, the sea level went up about 2
          metres in the last 2,000 years, so the ports and its structures are
          now under the Black Sea. In the 1960s and 1970s, Constantin Scarlat
          did an underwater survey and drew a map of the ancient harbour. He
          found many architectural fragments, lots of ceramic pieces, especially
          shingles and amphorae, and we have the map he published in 1973 in a
          science journal in Cluj. The map includes a few sunken ships as well.
          We worked with companies from Italy and Hungary which came to scan the
          bottom of the Black Sea in the Mangalia area, and their scanners have
          confirmed the presence of these ancient shipwrecks.” From a
          flourishing city, Callatis gradually suffered a dramatic decline,
          which Sorin Marcel Colesniuc says was the result of migrations: “In
          the 2nd century AD, the area saw the arrival of migratory populations.
          The first are the Costoboci, followed by the Goths, the Carpi and the
          Huns, in the 5th century. The Avars and the Slavs arrived in these
          parts in the late 6th and early 7th century. They dealt the final blow
          to Callatis, and for the next 300 years nothing is known of the city.
          No archaeological traces were found from this period. Later, around
          the 13th century, we encounter for the first time the name of Pangalia
          to refer to the site of the ancient Callatis. The Mangalia was first
          mentioned in historical records in 1593.” As is often the case with
          history, few traces remain of what was once the ancient city of
          Callatis and they tell us very little about the people who lived here.
