              <p>
              Histria or Istros (Ancient Greek: Ἰστρίη, Thracian river god,
              Danube), was a Greek colony or polis (πόλις, city) near the mouths
              of the Danube (known as Ister in Ancient Greek), on the western
              coast of the Black Sea.</p>
              <p>It was the first urban settlement on today's
              Romanian territory when founded by Milesiistria-an settlers in the
              7th century BC.</p>
              <p>From the 1st to 3rd centuries AD it was under Roman rule.</p>
              <p>Invasions during the 7th century AD rendered it
              indefensible, and the city was abandoned.</p>
              <p>In antiquity, it also bore
              the names Istropolis, Istriopolis, and Histriopolis (Ἰστρόπολις,
              Ἰστρία πόλις).</p>
              <p>
              Histriopolis was a fort in the Roman province of Moesia. As Tabula
              Peutingeriana shows it is situated between Tomis and Ad Stoma; 11
              miles from Tomis and 9 miles from Ad Stoma.

                <h4 class="center-content">Medea Legend</h4> 
                <p> One of the legends of this historic place says that the beautiful
                  Medea, the princess of Colchis (nowadays Georgia), flees from her
                  parents, taking with her, the little brother, Absirt.</p><p>Offended by
                  her deed, Aeetes, her father follows her ship and almost catch it
                  when Medea, frightened, kills her brother, cuts up his body and
                  scatters the parts on the sea to delay him and escape from his
                  anger.</p><p>The unhappy parent stops his ship every time he sees parts of
                  his beloved son. Overwhelming with all the pieces, Aeetes moors the
                  boat to bury the son.</p><p>This shore, the city that rose then here, has
                  been called Tomis which in Greek language means piece.

                <h4 class="center-content">Tomyris Legend</h4> 
                <p>According to Jordanes (after Cassiodorus), the foundation of the
                  city was ascribed to Tomyris, the queen of the Massagetae (the
                  origin and deeds of the Goths):
                  <blockquote>
                    After achieving this victory (against Cyrus the Great) and winning
                    so much booty from her enemies, Queen Tomyris crossed over into
                    that part of Moesia which is now called Lesser Scythia - a name
                    borrowed from Great Scythia -, and built on the Moesian shore of
                    the Black Sea the city of Tomi, named after herself.</blockquote>

                <h4 class="center-content">Chronology</h4> 
                <p>
                    Ruins of Tomis In 29 BC, the Romans captured the region from the
                    Odrysian kingdom, and annexed it as far as the Danube, under the
                    name of Limes Scythicus ("Scythian Frontier").</p>
                <p>In AD 8, the Emperor Augustus banished the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17AD) here by Augustus
                    for the last eight years of his life. He lamented his Tomisian exile
                    in his poems Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto.</p>
                <p>
                    Tomis was "by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural
                    wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire".
                    Casino after the occupation of the port of Constanța by Soviet sailors in 1944.
                    Statue of Ovid in front of the Museum of National History A number
                    of inscriptions found in and around the city show that Constanța
                    stands over the site of Tomis.</p>
                    <p>Some of these finds are now preserved in the British Museum in London. The city was
                    afterwards included in the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of
                    Diocletian, in Scythia Minor, of which it was the metropolis.</p>
                <p>
                    After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern
                    Roman Empire. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged
                    by the Avars in the winter of 597/598.</p>
                <p>
                    Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the
                    half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The
                    earliest known usage of this name was in 950.</p>
                    <p>The city lay at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and was surrounded by
                    fortifications of its own.

              <p>
                The Greek town Callatis existed until the mid-7th century under this
                name. Life in the town resumed from the 10th century. In the 13th
                century Callatis came to be known as Pangalia. The Vlachs called
                it Tomisovara and the Greeks called it Panglicara. From the
                16th century the town had acquired its present name, Mangalia.

              <h4 class="center-content">Chronology</h4> 
              <p>
                A Greek colony named Callatis was founded in the 6th century BC by
                the city of Heraclea Pontica. Its first silver coinage was minted
                around 350 BC. In 72 BC, Callatis was conquered by the Roman general
                Lucullus and was assigned to the Roman province of Moesia Inferior.
                Throughout the 2nd century AD, the city built defensive
                fortifications and the minting of coinage under the Roman emperors
                Septimius Severus and Caracalla continued.</p>
                <p>Callatis suffered
                multiple invasions in the 3rd century AD but recovered in the 4th
                century AD to regain its status as an important trade hub and port
                city.[6] From the 7th to the 11th century the city was under the
                rule of the First Bulgarian Empire.

            <div class="art-wr">
              <h4 class="center-content">Socioeconomic Development</h4> 
              <p>
                Experts and archaeologists agree that Callatis was the most
                important cultural centre in antiquity in the entire region of
                Dobrudja, an area lying between the Danube and the Black Sea.</p>
                <p>It was
                a great economic centre, especially thanks to its harbour. Callatis
                was built by Greek colonists from Heraclea Pontica on the site of an
                older Getae settlement known as Acervatis or Cerbatis.</p>
                <p>The
                inhabitants were at first a mixture of the local Getae population
                and the Greeks newly arrived. On the site once occupied by Callatis
                we find today the town of Mangalia, with a population of around
                33,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Sorin Marcel Colesniuc, the curator of the
                Callatis Museum, which is part of the Callatis Cultural Complex,
                told us about what has survived to this day of the ancient city of
                Callatis: <br>
                <blockquote style="font-size:0.9em;font-style:italic;">
                “First of all, we have a number of inscriptions we have
                dug up in Mangalia, as well as funeral stones featuring a number of
                ancient teachers. We also have the ancient writers in the old city
                of Callatis, such as Istros of Callatis, Demetrius of Callatis,
                Herakleides Lembos, and the philosopher Thales.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>In Mangalia, we
                found the only ancient papyrus discovered on Romanian territory. It
                was uncovered in 1959, and because the country didn’t have the
                proper conditions to preserve it, it was sent to Moscow. It was
                believed lost to researchers in Romania for half a century.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>I looked
                for this papyrus together with my colleague Ion Paslaru and found it
                after 2 years of searching, in 2011, at the Moscow Centre for
                Restoration and Conservation. That year we brought back to Romania
                this unique document.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>We don’t know exactly what the text says,
                because it disintegrated when exposed to air and sun after being
                found. It could have been lost forever, but luckily it got to Moscow
                and it was preserved.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Today there are 154 surviving fragments, and
                on the larger fragments we can make out letters in ancient Greek. We
                don’t have any complete word, just a few letters here and there. The
                papyrus dates back to the 4th century BC.”</blockquote>

                <h4 class="center-content">Visiting</h4> 
                <p>We asked Sorin Marcel Colesniuc what visitors can see in the Callatis Museum:
                  <blockquote>“The museum exhibits many architectural pieces, such as columns, capitals,
                  architraves, friezes with metopes, cornices featuring bucrania and
                  various ceramic vessels, the most important being the amphorae.
                  There are also oil lamps, aqueducts, Tanagra figurines, vessels made
                  of glass, funerary stelae, inscriptions, depictions of the gods,
                  jewels, coins and metal objects. In front of the museum, you can see
                  lots of architectural fragments.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>It is also an architectural
                  park, as well as the sites around Mangalia. You can see the north
                  wall of the city of Callatis and its north-western wall which has
                  been dug up and extensively studied.</blockquote>

              <div class="art-wr">
                <h4 class="center-content">The tomb - just few minutes away</h4> 
                <p>Another site worth a visit is a
                princely tomb located 3 km away from Mangalia, on the way to the
                village of Albesti.” The ancient harbour provides significant
                insight into the economy of the ancient city of Callatis.
                Unfortunately, however, it lies today below the sea surface.</p>
                <p>Sorin Marcel Colesniuc, the curator of the Callatis Museum, explains: <span style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;"></span>“The
                harbour in Callatis was built in the 4th century BC. Unfortunately,
                the sea level went up about 2 metres in the last 2,000 years, so the
                ports and its structures are now under the Black Sea. In the 1960s
                and 1970s, Constantin Scarlat did an underwater survey and drew a
                map of the ancient harbour. He found many architectural fragments,
                lots of ceramic pieces, especially shingles and amphorae, and we
                have the map he published in 1973 in a science journal in Cluj. The
                map includes a few sunken ships as well. We worked with companies
                from Italy and Hungary which came to scan the bottom of the Black
                Sea in the Mangalia area, and their scanners have confirmed the
                presence of these ancient shipwrecks.”</span></p>

              <div class="art-wr">
                <h4 class="center-content">The decline</h4> 
                <p>From a flourishing city,
                Callatis gradually suffered a dramatic decline, which Sorin Marcel
                Colesniuc says was the result of migrations: “In the 2nd century AD,
                the area saw the arrival of migratory populations. The first are the
                Costoboci, followed by the Goths, the Carpi and the Huns, in the 5th
                century. The Avars and the Slavs arrived in these parts in the late
                6th and early 7th century. They dealt the final blow to Callatis,
                and for the next 300 years nothing is known of the city. No
                archaeological traces were found from this period.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="art-wr">
                <h4 class="center-content">Pangalia</h4> 
                <p>Later, around the
                13th century, we encounter for the first time the name of Pangalia
                to refer to the site of the ancient Callatis. The Mangalia was first
                mentioned in historical records in 1593.”</p>
                <p>As is often the case with
                history, few traces remain of what was once the ancient city of
                Callatis and they tell us very little about the people who lived
                here.
