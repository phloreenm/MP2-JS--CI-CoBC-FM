          <h3>Short History</h3>
          <p>
            Histria or Istros (Ancient Greek: Ἰστρίη, Thracian river god,
            Danube), was a Greek colony or polis (πόλις, city) near the mouths
            of the Danube (known as Ister in Ancient Greek), on the western
            coast of the Black Sea. It was the first urban settlement on today's
            Romanian territory when founded by Milesian settlers in the 7th
            century BC. It was under Roman rule from the 1st to 3rd centuries
            AD. Invasions during the 7th century AD rendered it indefensible,
            and the city was abandoned. In antiquity, it also bore the names
            Istropolis, Istriopolis, and Histriopolis (Ἰστρόπολις, Ἰστρία
            πόλις).[1]
            <br /><br />
            Histriopolis was a fort in the Roman province of Moesia. As Tabula
            Peutingeriana shows it is situated between Tomis and Ad Stoma; 11
            miles from Tomis and 9 miles from Ad Stoma.

          <h3></h3>
          <p>
            One of the legends of this historic place says that the beautiful
            Medea, the princess of Colchis (nowadays Georgia), flees from her
            parents, taking with her, the little brother, Absirt. Offended by
            her deed, Aeetes, her father follows her ship and almost catch it
            when Medea, frightened, kills her brother, cuts up his body and
            scatters the parts on the sea to delay him and escape from his
            anger. The unhappy parent stops his ship every time he sees parts of
            his beloved son. Overwhelming with all the pieces, Aeetes moors the
            boat to bury the son. This shore, the city that rose then here, has
            been called Tomis which in Greek language means piece.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            According to Jordanes (after Cassiodorus), the foundation of the
            city was ascribed to Tomyris, the queen of the Massagetae (the
            origin and deeds of the Goths):
            <span style="font-size: 1.1em">
              After achieving this victory (against Cyrus the Great) and winning
              so much booty from her enemies, Queen Tomyris crossed over into
              that part of Moesia which is now called Lesser Scythia - a name
              borrowed from Great Scythia -, and built on the Moesian shore of
              the Black Sea the city of Tomi, named after herself.</span

            Ruins of Tomis In 29 BC, the Romans captured the region from the
            Odrysian kingdom, and annexed it as far as the Danube, under the
            name of Limes Scythicus ("Scythian Frontier"). In AD 8, the Emperor
            Augustus banished the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17AD) here by Augustus
            for the last eight years of his life. He lamented his Tomisian exile
            in his poems Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto.<br /><br />
            Tomis was "by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural
            wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire".[13] Casino after
            the occupation of the port of Constanța by Soviet sailors in 1944.
            Statue of Ovid in front of the Museum of National History A number
            of inscriptions found in and around the city show that Constanța
            stands over the site of Tomis.[14] Some of these finds are now
            preserved in the British Museum in London.[15] The city was
            afterwards included in the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of
            Diocletian, in Scythia Minor, of which it was the metropolis.<br /><br />
            After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern
            Roman Empire. During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged
            by the Avars in the winter of 597/598.<br />
            <br />
            Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the
            half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The
            earliest known usage of this name was in 950. The city lay at the
            seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and was surrounded by
            fortifications of its own.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            The Greek town Callatis existed until the mid-7th century under this
            name. Life in the town resumed from the 10th century. In the 13th
            century Callatis came to be known as Pangalia.[3] The Vlachs called
            it Tomisovara[4] and the Greeks called it Panglicara.[4] From the
            16th century the town had acquired its present name, Mangalia.
            <br />
            A Greek colony named Callatis was founded in the 6th century BC by
            the city of Heraclea Pontica.[5] Its first silver coinage was minted
            around 350 BC. In 72 BC, Callatis was conquered by the Roman general
            Lucullus and was assigned to the Roman province of Moesia Inferior.
            Throughout the 2nd century AD, the city built defensive
            fortifications and the minting of coinage under the Roman emperors
            Septimius Severus and Caracalla continued. Callatis suffered
            multiple invasions in the 3rd century AD but recovered in the 4th
            century AD to regain its status as an important trade hub and port
            city.[6] From the 7th to the 11th century the city was under the
            rule of the First Bulgarian Empire.
            <br />
            <br />
            Experts and archaeologists agree that Callatis was the most
            important cultural centre in antiquity in the entire region of
            Dobrudja, an area lying between the Danube and the Black Sea. It was
            a great economic centre, especially thanks to its harbour. Callatis
            was built by Greek colonists from Heraclea Pontica on the site of an
            older Getae settlement known as Acervatis or Cerbatis. The
            inhabitants were at first a mixture of the local Getae population
            and the Greeks newly arrived. On the site once occupied by Callatis
            we find today the town of Mangalia, with a population of around
            33,000 inhabitants. Sorin Marcel Colesniuc, the curator of the
            Callatis Museum, which is part of the Callatis Cultural Complex,
            told us about what has survived to this day of the ancient city of
            Callatis: “First of all, we have a number of inscriptions we have
            dug up in Mangalia, as well as funeral stones featuring a number of
            ancient teachers. We also have the ancient writers in the old city
            of Callatis, such as Istros of Callatis, Demetrius of Callatis,
            Herakleides Lembos, and the philosopher Thales. In Mangalia, we
            found the only ancient papyrus discovered on Romanian territory. It
            was uncovered in 1959, and because the country didn’t have the
            proper conditions to preserve it, it was sent to Moscow. It was
            believed lost to researchers in Romania for half a century. I looked
            for this papyrus together with my colleague Ion Paslaru and found it
            after 2 years of searching, in 2011, at the Moscow Centre for
            Restoration and Conservation. That year we brought back to Romania
            this unique document. We don’t know exactly what the text says,
            because it disintegrated when exposed to air and sun after being
            found. It could have been lost forever, but luckily it got to Moscow
            and it was preserved. Today there are 154 surviving fragments, and
            on the larger fragments we can make out letters in ancient Greek. We
            don’t have any complete word, just a few letters here and there. The
            papyrus dates back to the 4th century BC.” We asked Sorin Marcel
            Colesniuc what visitors can see in the Callatis Museum: “The museum
            exhibits many architectural pieces, such as columns, capitals,
            architraves, friezes with metopes, cornices featuring bucrania and
            various ceramic vessels, the most important being the amphorae.
            There are also oil lamps, aqueducts, Tanagra figurines, vessels made
            of glass, funerary stelae, inscriptions, depictions of the gods,
            jewels, coins and metal objects. In front of the museum, you can see
            lots of architectural fragments. There is also an architectural
            park, as well as the sites around Mangalia. You can see the north
            wall of the city of Callatis and its north-western wall which has
            been dug up and extensively studied. Another site worth a visit is a
            princely tomb located 3 km away from Mangalia, on the way to the
            village of Albesti.” The ancient harbour provides significant
            insight into the economy of the ancient city of Callatis.
            Unfortunately, however, it lies today below the sea surface. Sorin
            Marcel Colesniuc, the curator of the Callatis Museum, explains: “The
            harbour in Callatis was built in the 4th century BC. Unfortunately,
            the sea level went up about 2 metres in the last 2,000 years, so the
            ports and its structures are now under the Black Sea. In the 1960s
            and 1970s, Constantin Scarlat did an underwater survey and drew a
            map of the ancient harbour. He found many architectural fragments,
            lots of ceramic pieces, especially shingles and amphorae, and we
            have the map he published in 1973 in a science journal in Cluj. The
            map includes a few sunken ships as well. We worked with companies
            from Italy and Hungary which came to scan the bottom of the Black
            Sea in the Mangalia area, and their scanners have confirmed the
            presence of these ancient shipwrecks.” From a flourishing city,
            Callatis gradually suffered a dramatic decline, which Sorin Marcel
            Colesniuc says was the result of migrations: “In the 2nd century AD,
            the area saw the arrival of migratory populations. The first are the
            Costoboci, followed by the Goths, the Carpi and the Huns, in the 5th
            century. The Avars and the Slavs arrived in these parts in the late
            6th and early 7th century. They dealt the final blow to Callatis,
            and for the next 300 years nothing is known of the city. No
            archaeological traces were found from this period. Later, around the
            13th century, we encounter for the first time the name of Pangalia
            to refer to the site of the ancient Callatis. The Mangalia was first
            mentioned in historical records in 1593.” As is often the case with
            history, few traces remain of what was once the ancient city of
            Callatis and they tell us very little about the people who lived
            here.
