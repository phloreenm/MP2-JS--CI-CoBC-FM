            <h4 class="center-content">Briefly about</h4>
            <p>Histria or Istros (Ancient Greek: Ἰστρίη, Thracian river god, Danube), was a Greek colony or polis (πόλις, city) near the mouths of the Danube (known as Ister in Ancient Greek), on the western coast of the Black Sea.</p>
            <p>It was the first urban settlement on today's Romanian territory when founded by Milesiistria-an settlers in the 7th century BC.</p>
            <p>From the 1st to 3rd centuries AD it was under Roman rule.</p>
            <p>Invasions during the 7th century AD rendered it indefensible, and the city was abandoned.</p>
            <p>In antiquity, it also bore the names Istropolis, Istriopolis, and Histriopolis (Ἰστρόπολις, Ἰστρία πόλις).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Name's history</h4>
            <p>The etymology of its name, Histria, seems to be connected with the ancient name of river Danube, Istros ( ̉Ίστρος ), according to information provided by Pseudo-Skymnos (Periegesis, 765). </p>
            <p>Danube had a different course when Histra was settled as a Milesian colony on the western shore of Pontos Euxeinos (Black Sea). </p>
            <p>One of its ancient channels, that no longer exists today, was flowing much closer to ancient Histria. </p>
            <p>Herodotus locates Danube's mouth close to the place where Histria was settled by colonists from Milet (Hist., II, 33).</p>
            <p>Also, according to Plinius the Elder, from Histria upwards (towards North), Danube's channels were flowing (Nat. Hist., IV, 11 (18), 41).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">History</h4>
            <p>Established by Milesian settlers in order to facilitate trade with the native Getae, it is considered the oldest urban settlement on Romanian territory. </p>
            <p>Scymnus of Chios (ca 110 BC), dated its founding to 630 BC, while Eusebius of Caesarea set it during the time of the 33rd Olympic Games (657 – 656 BC). </p>
            <!-- <p>Histria este primul oras grecesc de pe tarmul Marii Negre care a batut monezi, fiind astfel foarte probabil sa fi fost membru al Ligii Delaine din Atena.</p> -->
            <p>Histria is the first greek city from the shores of the Black Sea which had it's own currency and it's quite probable the city was a member of
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Delian League"> Athens' Delian League</a>.
            </p>
            <p>The earliest documented currency on today's Romanian territory was an 8-gram silver drachma, issued by the city around 480 BC.</p>
            <p>Archaeological evidence seems to confirm that all trade with the interior followed the foundation of Histria. </p>
            <p>Traders reached the interior via Histria and the Danube valley, demonstrated by finds of Attic black-figure pottery, coins, ornamental objects, an Ionian lebes and many fragments of amphoras.</p>
            <p>Amphoras have been found in great quantity at Histria, some imported but some local. </p>
            <p>Local pottery was produced following establishment of the colony and certainly before the mid-6th century. During the archaic and classical periods, when Histria flourished, it was situated near fertile arable land. </p>
            <p>It served as a port of trade soon after its establishment, with fishing and agriculture as additional sources of income.</p>
            <p>By 100 AD, however, fishing had become the main source of Istrian revenue.</p>

          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Roman domination</h4>
            <p>Around 30 AD, Histria came under Roman domination. </p>
            <p>During the Roman period from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, temples were built for the Roman gods, besides a public bath and houses for the wealthy.</p>

          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Existence</h4>
            <p>Altogether, it was in continuous existence for some 14 centuries, starting with the Greek period up to the Roman-Byzantine period.</p>
            <p>The Halmyris bay where was the city founded was closed by sand deposits and access to the Black Sea gradually was cut.</p>
            <p>Trade continued until the 6th century AD. </p>

            <p>The invasion of the Avars and the Slavs in the 7th century AD almost entirely destroyed the fortress, and the Istrians dispersed; the name and the city disappeared.

            <h4 class="center-content">Briefly about Tomis</h4>
            <p>Today's Constanta, historically known as Tomis (Ancient Greek: Τόμις),
              is the oldest continuously inhabited city in Romania, and among the oldest in Europe.</p>
            <p>The city was founded in the 7th century BC by Greek settlers from Miletus in Anatolia and was given the name Tomis, possibly in honour of Queen Tomyris. </p>
            <p>The founding of the city is also associated with the legend of the Argonauts who were to found a settlement here before they sailed across the Black Sea in search of the golden fleece.</p>
            <p>The city was founded in a convenient place from the point of view of security - on a peninsula that cuts into the sea and is surrounded on three sides by water.</p>
            <p>In both Greek and Roman times, it was an important port on the Black Sea.</p>
            <p>Until 29 BCE the entire region south of the Danube, and the city with it, was conquered by the Romans and from that time until the 8th century CE its fate was inseparable from the history of the Roman Empire, and later Byzantium as part of the province Moesia Inferior.

          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Medea Legend</h4>
            <p> One of the legends of this historic place says that the beautiful
              Medea, the princess of Colchis (nowadays Georgia), flees from her
              parents, taking with her, the little brother, Absirt.</p>
            <p>Offended by
              her deed, Aeetes, her father follows her ship and almost catch it
              when Medea, frightened, kills her brother, cuts up his body and
              scatters the parts on the sea to delay him and escape from his
              anger.</p>
            <p>The unhappy parent stops his ship every time he sees parts of
              his beloved son. Overwhelming with all the pieces, Aeetes moors the
              boat to bury the son.</p>
            <p>This shore, the city that rose then here, has
              been called Tomis which in Greek language means piece.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Tomyris Legend</h4>
            <p>According to Jordanes (after Cassiodorus), the foundation of the
              city was ascribed to Tomyris, the queen of the Massagetae (the
              origin and deeds of the Goths):</p>
            <blockquote>
              After achieving this victory (against Cyrus the Great) and winning
              so much booty from her enemies, Queen Tomyris crossed over into
              that part of Moesia which is now called Lesser Scythia - a name
              borrowed from Great Scythia -, and built on the Moesian shore of
              the Black Sea the city of Tomi, named after herself.</blockquote>

          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">

            <h4 class="center-content">The Hellenistic period</h4>
            <p>Even since it was founded, Tomis benefited from a docking place for the trade ships.</p>
            <p>In spite of the fact no written information localize exactly the city port and mention the way this
              port was organized and what installations used to have, the quantity of imported material from different Pontic,
              Aegean etc centres, images of sailors near their ships on the funerary stones, the presence of the shipowners
              from Alexandria at Tomis, coins issued in different well-known trade centres represent the evidence for the
              intense commercial activity and implicitly the port activity at Tomis.</p>
            <p>The 6-4th centuries are well documented archaeologically at Tomis by various types of ceramics coming from different
              places (Greek-Oriental ceramics, Attic ceramics, colonial ceramics), which beside the monetary discoveries attest
              trade relationships with centres as: Histria, Callatis, Chios, Lesbos, Thassos, Apollonia Pontica, Mesambria etc.</p>
            <p>The city lay at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and was surrounded by
              fortifications of its own.
            </p>

            <h4 class="center-content">The Roman period</h4>
            <p>Tomis gradually took over the features specific to a Roman city,
              but the Greek traditions continued to exist at material, cultural, administrative, linguistic etc. level.</p>
            <p>
              Ruins of Tomis In 29 BC, the Romans captured the region from the
              Odrysian kingdom, and annexed it as far as the Danube, under the
              name of Limes Scythicus ("Scythian Frontier").</p>
            <p>In AD 8, the Emperor Augustus banished the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-17AD) here by Augustus
              for the last eight years of his life. He lamented his Tomisian exile
              in his poems Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto.</p>
            <p>
              Tomis was by his account "a town located in a war-stricken cultural
              wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire".

            <p>
              Statue of Ovidius in front of the Museum of National History A number
              of inscriptions found in and around the city show that Constanța
              stands over the site of Tomis.
            </p>
            <p>Some of these finds are now preserved in the British Museum in London. The city was
              afterwards included in the Province of Moesia, and, from the time of
              Diocletian, in Scythia Minor, of which it was the metropolis.</p>
            <p>
              After the 5th century, Tomis fell under the rule of the Eastern
              Roman Empire.

            <h4 class="center-content">Later</h4>
            <p>
              During Maurice's Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged
              by the Avars in the winter of 597/598.</p>
            <h4 class="center-content">Constanta</h4>
            <p>
              Tomis was later renamed to Constantiana in honour of Constantia, the
              half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (274-337). The
              earliest known usage of this name was in 950.</p>

            <h4 class="center-content">Brief History</h4>
            <p>Pseudo-Skymnos informs us that the Greek colony was set up by the Herakleans,
              following the indications of an oracle (most probably the one at Delphi,
              as several other inscriptions suggest), during Amynthas’ rule over Makedonia.</p>
            <p>Hence the question if it happened during the reign of Amynthas I (second half of
              the 6th century BC) or Amynthas III (first part of the 4th century BC).</p>
            <p>Several other literary sources, as well as epigraphic, historical and archaeological
              information point towards the first presumption, placing the foundation of Callatis
              in the second half of the 6th century BC.</p>
            <p>The Greek town Callatis existed until the mid-7th century under this
              name. Life in the town resumed from the 10th century. In the 13th
              century Callatis came to be known as Pangalia. The Vlachs called
              it Tomisovara and the Greeks called it Panglicara. From the
              16th century the town had acquired its present name, Mangalia.

            <h4 class="center-content">Name's history</h4>
            <p>Plinius the Elder, informs us about an early name of this Heraclean colony - Cerbatis (Nat. Hist., 11(18), 44). </p>
            <p>An inscription discovered at Dionysopolis (IGB V 5011) states that the southern confines of the Callatian territory, were marked by Καρβατις, presumably a river situated South of Callatis.</p>
            <p>Therefore the name is epigraphically attested as a hydronym, not as a toponym.</p>
            <p>As most of the ancient Greek cities Callatis had also had an etymology related by Stephan of Byzance to the greek word κάλαθος.</p>
            <p>This situation must be regarded as an incidental word resemblance.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">History</h4>
            <p>
              A Greek colony named Callatis was founded in the 6th century BC by
              the city of Heraclea Pontica.</p>
            <p>From its very beginning Callatis developed as a typical Dorian colony. </p>
            <p>Its first silver coinage was minted
              around 350 BC. In 72 BC, Callatis was conquered by the Roman general
              Lucullus and was assigned to the Roman province of Moesia Inferior.</p>
            <p>
              Throughout the 2nd century AD, the city built defensive
              fortifications and the minting of coinage under the Roman emperors
              Septimius Severus and Caracalla continued.</p>
            <p>Callatis suffered
              multiple invasions in the 3rd century AD but recovered in the 4th
              century AD to regain its status as an important trade hub and port
              city.</p>
            <p> From the 7th to the 11th century the city was under the
              rule of the First Bulgarian Empire.

          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Socioeconomic Development</h4>
            <p>
              Experts and archaeologists agree that Callatis was the most
              important cultural centre in antiquity in the entire region of
              Dobrudja, an area lying between the Danube and the Black Sea.</p>
            <p>It was
              a great economic centre, especially thanks to its harbour. Callatis
              was built by Greek colonists from Heraclea Pontica on the site of an
              older Getae settlement known as Acervatis or Cerbatis.</p>
            <p>The
              inhabitants were at first a mixture of the local Getae population
              and the Greeks newly arrived. On the site once occupied by Callatis
              we find today the town of Mangalia, with a population of around
              33,000 inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Sorin Marcel Colesniuc, the curator of the
              Callatis Museum, which is part of the Callatis Cultural Complex,
              told us about what has survived to this day of the ancient city of
              Callatis: <br>
            <blockquote style="font-size:0.9em;font-style:italic;">
              “First of all, we have a number of inscriptions we have
              dug up in Mangalia, as well as funeral stones featuring a number of
              ancient teachers. We also have the ancient writers in the old city
              of Callatis, such as Istros of Callatis, Demetrius of Callatis,
              Herakleides Lembos, and the philosopher Thales.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>In Mangalia, we
              found the only ancient papyrus discovered on Romanian territory. It
              was uncovered in 1959, and because the country didn’t have the
              proper conditions to preserve it, it was sent to Moscow. It was
              believed lost to researchers in Romania for half a century.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>I looked
              for this papyrus together with my colleague Ion Paslaru and found it
              after 2 years of searching, in 2011, at the Moscow Centre for
              Restoration and Conservation. That year we brought back to Romania
              this unique document.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>We don’t know exactly what the text says,
              because it disintegrated when exposed to air and sun after being
              found. It could have been lost forever, but luckily it got to Moscow
              and it was preserved.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Today there are 154 surviving fragments, and
              on the larger fragments we can make out letters in ancient Greek. We
              don’t have any complete word, just a few letters here and there. The
              papyrus dates back to the 4th century BC.”</blockquote>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Visiting</h4>
            <p>We asked Sorin Marcel Colesniuc what visitors can see in the Callatis Museum:
            <blockquote>“The museum exhibits many architectural pieces, such as columns, capitals,
              architraves, friezes with metopes, cornices featuring bucrania and
              various ceramic vessels, the most important being the amphorae.
              There are also oil lamps, aqueducts, Tanagra figurines, vessels made
              of glass, funerary stelae, inscriptions, depictions of the gods,
              jewels, coins and metal objects. In front of the museum, you can see
              lots of architectural fragments.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>It is also an architectural
              park, as well as the sites around Mangalia. You can see the north
              wall of the city of Callatis and its north-western wall which has
              been dug up and extensively studied.</blockquote>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">The tomb - just few minutes away</h4>
            <p>Another site worth a visit is a
              princely tomb located 3 km away from Mangalia, on the way to the
              village of Albesti.” The ancient harbour provides significant
              insight into the economy of the ancient city of Callatis.
              Unfortunately, however, it lies today below the sea surface.</p>
            <p>Sorin Marcel Colesniuc, the curator of the Callatis Museum, explains: <span style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;"></span>“The
              harbour in Callatis was built in the 4th century BC. Unfortunately,
              the sea level went up about 2 metres in the last 2,000 years, so the
              ports and its structures are now under the Black Sea. In the 1960s
              and 1970s, Constantin Scarlat did an underwater survey and drew a
              map of the ancient harbour. He found many architectural fragments,
              lots of ceramic pieces, especially shingles and amphorae, and we
              have the map he published in 1973 in a science journal in Cluj. The
              map includes a few sunken ships as well. We worked with companies
              from Italy and Hungary which came to scan the bottom of the Black
              Sea in the Mangalia area, and their scanners have confirmed the
              presence of these ancient shipwrecks.”</span></p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">The decline</h4>
            <p>From a flourishing city,
              Callatis gradually suffered a dramatic decline, which Sorin Marcel
              Colesniuc says was the result of migrations: “In the 2nd century AD,
              the area saw the arrival of migratory populations. The first are the
              Costoboci, followed by the Goths, the Carpi and the Huns, in the 5th
              century. The Avars and the Slavs arrived in these parts in the late
              6th and early 7th century. They dealt the final blow to Callatis,
              and for the next 300 years nothing is known of the city. No
              archaeological traces were found from this period.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="art-wr">
            <h4 class="center-content">Pangalia</h4>
            <p>Later, around the
              13th century, we encounter for the first time the name of Pangalia
              to refer to the site of the ancient Callatis. The Mangalia was first
              mentioned in historical records in 1593.”</p>
            <p>As is often the case with
              history, few traces remain of what was once the ancient city of
              Callatis and they tell us very little about the people who lived
              here.
